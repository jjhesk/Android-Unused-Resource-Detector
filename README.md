# Android-Unused-Resource-Detector
Andround Unused Resources is a Java application that will scan your project for unused resources. Unused resources needlessly take up space, increase the build time, and clutter the IDE's autocomplete list.



To use it, ensure your working directory is the root of your Android project, and run:

```java -jar AndroidUnusedResources.jar```
